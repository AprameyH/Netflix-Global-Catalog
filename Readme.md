Netflix's movie availability varies wildly between countries. Not finding a movie can be quite frustrating, and many people have taken to VPNs to unlock the potential of Netflix's global catalog. However, Netflix does not advertise regional movie availability. This application intends to provide users with accurate regional availability data, allowing them to unlock the potential of Netflix's global catalog. The application will track past user searches to recommend movies based on tags like actor, director, genre etc.

The team's progress and contributions can be tracked in the doc folder.
