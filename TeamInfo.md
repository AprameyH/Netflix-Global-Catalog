## Project Summary
During the pandemic, media services like Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video replaced movie theaters and took people’s homes based on convenience and a variety of entertainment content. We found that while Netflix might offer a title, it isn't always available in our country. To solve this problem, we looked to VPN services, but found that Netflix does not advertise regional movie availability. Moreover, current unofficial services that list the countries a title is available in are limited by UIs are not user-friendly. Their information is sometimes outdated or inaccurate. Thus, we decided to make ‘Netflix Global Availability Catalog’ for a more satisfactory experience for users. 

Our goal is that users can search for a Netflix title and they will be able to view the countries where the title is available and information about the movie. When the user selects a title, we query the catalog table to read data about the title. Users would also be able to select a country to display all applicable titles. Another function is tracking past user searches to recommend movies based on tags like actors, director, genre etc. We will get the data by scraping Netflix title catalogs on the internet.
