1. There were not any major directional changes for our project. In stage 1 we proposed a site that offered a catalog of movies and allowed users to search based on available countries, as well as provide reccomendations based on user history - and that is what we stayed with and delivered.
2. We think we met our basic and complex goals in the technical aspects. We think the overall look of the site did not meet the original design we imagined, and the login system we implemented is not very secure, but the overall useful aspect of the site is solid and provides a good service to the user.
3. We did not change the source data for the site, but we did end up altering the schema to include a Recommendation table for managing that aspect of our site.
4. First, we did not implement a Favorites table. This was an extra feature we envisioned but it was not necessary for our core functionality. Additionally, we added a table called Recommendation when we realized that the task of generating recommendations would be much easier if it were included in our schema. This proved to be much easier to work with.
5. As mentioned, we removed the favorites feature. We added the additional feature of adding new movies to the database, and the ability for users to update/delete their accounts.
6. The advanced query for country availability is essential to the core functionality of our site. The recommendation advanced query adds another key feature to be enjoyed by users of the site.
7. 
8. The method of displaying the movies differed from our original conception.
9. The user login system could be improved upon. Managing sessions should likely not be handled by the database.
10. Work was divided mostly evenly. As a team we could have worked better to begin working earlier each deadline - we often began work with a few days to go. But each team member contributed at each stage.
